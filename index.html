        <h2>Summary </h2>
    </center>
    <p>Dedicated and ambitious Chemistry student at the Polytechnique University of Antananarivo with a specialization in industrial chemistry. 
     Throughout the academic journey, I have gained practical experience and research skills through various internships, 
     including a QHSE internship with a local company. My passion for environmental chemistry inspires me to pursue a career focused on finding innovative waste management solutions
     and contributing to the development of a zero-waste circular economy in my country. Strongly believing in the interdependence of chemistry and the environment,
     I am highly motivated to make a positive impact in my community and beyond by addressing pressing waste management challenges with sustainable approaches.</p>
